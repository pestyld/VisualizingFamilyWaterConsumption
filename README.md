# Visualizing Family Water Consumption

## Description
Have you ever been curious about your monthly water consumption and how it compares to others in your community? Recently, I had this question and decided to get ahold of my family's water usage data for analysis. Harnessing the power of data visualization, I compared my family of four's monthly water consumption against the town of Cary, North Carolina's average.

## Requirements
- This code will run on SAS9 or SAS Viya
